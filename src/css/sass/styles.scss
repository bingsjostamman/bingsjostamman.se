 * STYLES
 *
 * This file @imports bits and pieces. The css are written to SCSS files,

 * is written in pure CSS. Some foundation stuff needs advanced calculations,
 * and is this written as Sass functions and mixins.
 *
 *
 * BASE
 * All ..................... The Base layer consists of tools and helpers and
 *                           since they don't produce any CSS they can be glob
 *                           imported.

 * All ..................... The Config layer consists of design tokens and

 * PATTERNS
 * All ..................... Patterns should be componentized and un-independent

/* SHAME
 * Shame ................... The place to put hacks and quick fixes. Just make

 *                           to where it really should reside.

 *
 * UTILITIES
 * All ..................... The Utility layer consists of utility helpers that
